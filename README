== Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Mercurial SCM Plugin for Mingle. Within this repository are two projects. The first is java_source_browser, containing a Java implementation of the source browser functionality required by the plugin. The second, rails_plugin, depends upon java_source_browser and is the proper rails plugin that provides Hg integration to Mingle.

Features include:

* Supports local and remote repositories
* Mingle history integration
* Mingle revision view
* Mingle source browser

== INSTALL:

Starting with release 3.0 of Mingle, this plugin is distributed with Mingle. 

If you wish to build and install from source:

* cd to rails_plugin
* ./jrake
* cp dist/mingle_hg_plugin.tar.gz to MINGLE_ROOT/vendor/plguins
* expand the tarball
* restart Mingle

This plugin must first make a local clone of any configured repositories, so there may be a bit of a delay from when you first configure a project to use this plugin to when you start seeing revisions in the project's history.

== SPECIAL NOTE FOR OS X 

Be sure that your hg executable is available on the PATH to Mingle, otherwise the plugin will not work. 

If you are using the tar.gz installer, use normal UNIX means of putting hg on your PATH.

If you are using the Mac OS X GUI launcher, you will need to make this PATH entry in you ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file (if this file does not exist, create it):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist SYSTEM "file://localhost/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList.dtd">
<plist version="0.9">
<dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/opt/local/bin:/usr/bin</string>
</dict>
</plist>

== REMAINING WORK:

* Implement Mingle-style revision diffs
* Performance and overly complex implementation still a big concern with source browser.
