# HgChangeset represents a log entry for a single Hg changeset. Beyond the basic
# changeset attributes such as identifier and person, HgChangeset has a changes
# collection that contains a fair bit of detail about each path included in the changeset.
#
# HgChangeset attributes and methods are named according to Mercurial conventions. Mingle's requirements 
# are met by the  identifier, number, message, commit_message, version_control_user, and changed_paths aliases.
